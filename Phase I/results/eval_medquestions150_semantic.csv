What are the genetic changes related to familial adenomatous polyposis ?,"Mutations in the APC gene cause both classic and attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis. These mutations affect the ability of the cell to maintain normal growth and function. Cell overgrowth resulting from mutations in the APC gene leads to the colon polyps seen in familial adenomatous polyposis. Although most people with mutations in the APC gene will develop colorectal cancer, the number of polyps and the time frame in which they become malignant depend on the location of the mutation in the gene.  Mutations in the MUTYH gene cause autosomal recessive familial adenomatous polyposis (also called MYH-associated polyposis). Mutations in this gene prevent cells from correcting mistakes that are made when DNA is copied (DNA replication) in preparation for cell division. As these mistakes build up in a person's DNA, the likelihood of cell overgrowth increases, leading to colon polyps and the possibility of colon cancer.",Germline mutation in the *APC* gene.,0.559506,0,"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is primarily caused by mutations in the APC gene (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli). These mutations lead to the development of numerous colorectal polyps and an increased risk of colorectal cancer.

How to diagnose National Hormone and Pituitary Program (NHPP): Information for People Treated with Pituitary Human Growth Hormone (Comprehensive Report) ?,"CJD is usually diagnosed based on signs and symptoms of the illness, how severe they are, and how quickly they become worse. However, doctors must study brain tissue from a biopsy or autopsy in order to make a definite diagnosis of CJD.
                
Other tests can suggest CJD. In 1996, researchers developed a test that helps doctors diagnose CJD in patients with symptoms. This test detects an abnormal protein in a sample of spinal fluid. When this protein is found, it helps make a diagnosis of CJD. It is much easier and safer to take a sample of spinal fluid than to do a brain biopsy. Unfortunately, this test cannot identify CJD in patients who do not have symptoms. The test cannot predict who may develop CJD in the future.
                
Researchers from many countries, including the United States, have reported success using MRI to diagnose CJD and vCJD in people with symptoms of the disease. MRI is a safe and painless tool that allows doctors to look at images of the brain and does not involve the collection of brain or spinal fluid samples.","NHPP is a program providing information for individuals treated with pituitary human growth hormone, not a medical condition. Therefore, it cannot be diagnosed.",0.24462187,0,"To diagnose conditions related to the National Hormone and Pituitary Program (NHPP) and treatment with pituitary human growth hormone, a comprehensive evaluation typically includes:

Is Spastic diplegia cerebral palsy inherited ?,"Is spastic diplegia cerebral palsy inherited? Scientists have found that family members of people with cerebral palsy, including spastic diplegia cerebral palsy, have an increased risk of developing the condition. The exact risk depends on the how closely the family members are related: A child with a sibling (brother, sister) or parent with cerebral palsy would have a six- to nine-fold increased risk of developing the condition (actual risk: 1 to 1.5%) A child with a half sibling with cerebral palsy would have up to a three-fold risk of developing the condition (actual risk: less than 1%) A child with a first cousin with cerebral palsy would have a 1.5-fold increased risk of developing the condition (actual risk: less than 1%) This suggests that there may be a genetic component in some cases of cerebral palsy. However, the inheritance is likely multifactorial which means the condition is caused by multiple genes interacting with each other and with environmental factors.","Generally no.

Spastic diplegia, a type of cerebral palsy, is typically caused by brain damage that occurs before, during, or shortly after birth, not by inheritance. While rare genetic factors can sometimes increase risk, it's not directly passed down.",0.79865587,1,"Spastic diplegia cerebral palsy is not typically inherited.

Is restless legs syndrome inherited ?,"The inheritance pattern of restless legs syndrome is usually unclear because many genetic and environmental factors can be involved. The disorder often runs in families: 40 to 90 percent of affected individuals report having at least one affected first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, and many families have multiple affected family members. Studies suggest that the early-onset form of the disorder is more likely to run in families than the late-onset form.  In some affected families, restless legs syndrome appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance suggests that one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. However, the genetic changes associated with restless legs syndrome in these families have not been identified.","Yes, it often has a strong genetic component, particularly the primary form of the syndrome.",0.5790839,0,"Yes, restless legs syndrome (RLS) can have a genetic component and may run in families.

How to diagnose Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ?,"How is nonalcoholic steatohepatitis diagnosed? NASH is usually first suspected when elevations are noted in liver tests that are included in routine blood test panels. These may include alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST). When further evaluation shows no apparent reason for liver disease (such as medications, viral hepatitis, or excessive use of alcohol) and when x-rays or imaging studies of the liver show fat, NASH is suspected. The only way to definitely diagnosis NASH and separate it from simple fatty liver is through a liver biopsy. For a liver biopsy, a needle is inserted through the skin to remove a small piece of the liver. NASH is diagnosed when examination of the tissue with a microscope shows fat along with inflammation and damage to liver cells. If the tissue shows fat without inflammation and damage, simple fatty liver or NAFLD is diagnosed. An important piece of information learned from the biopsy is whether scar tissue has developed in the liver. Blood tests and scans cannot reliably provide this information at this time.","Definitive diagnosis requires a **liver biopsy** to confirm steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocellular injury. This is supported by clinical evaluation, blood tests to rule out other liver diseases, and imaging studies showing fat in the liver.",0.7516587,1,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is diagnosed through a combination of clinical evaluation, imaging studies, and liver biopsy.

How to diagnose Von Willebrand Disease ?,"Early diagnosis of von Willebrand disease (VWD) is important to make sure that you're treated and can live a normal, active life.
                
Sometimes VWD is hard to diagnose. People who have type 1 or type 2 VWD may not have major bleeding problems. Thus, they may not be diagnosed unless they have heavy bleeding after surgery or some other trauma.
                
On the other hand, type 3 VWD can cause major bleeding problems during infancy and childhood. So, children who have type 3 VWD usually are diagnosed during their first year of life.
                
To find out whether you have VWD, your doctor will review your medical history and the results from a physical exam and tests.
                
Medical History
                
Your doctor will likely ask questions about your medical history and your family's medical history. He or she may ask about:
                
Any bleeding from a small wound that lasted more than 15 minutes or started up again within the first 7 days following the injury.
                
Any prolonged, heavy, or repeated bleeding that required medical care after surgery or dental extractions.
                
Any bruising with little or no apparent trauma, especially if you could feel a lump under the bruise.
                
Any nosebleeds that occurred for no known reason and lasted more than 10 minutes despite pressure on the nose, or any nosebleeds that needed medical attention.
                
Any blood in your stools for no known reason.
                
Any heavy menstrual bleeding (for women). This bleeding usually involves clots or lasts longer than 7 to 10 days.
                
Any history of muscle or joint bleeding.
                
Any medicines you've taken that might cause bleeding or increase the risk of bleeding. Examples include aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), clopidogrel, warfarin, or heparin.
                
Any history of liver or kidney disease, blood or bone marrow disease, or high or low blood platelet counts.
                
Physical Exam
                
Your doctor will do a physical exam to look for unusual bruising or other signs of recent bleeding. He or she also will look for signs of liver disease or anemia (a low red blood cell count).
                
Diagnostic Tests
                
No single test can diagnose VWD. Your doctor may recommend one or more blood tests to diagnose the disorder. These tests may include:
                
Von Willebrand factor antigen. This test measures the amount of von Willebrand factor in your blood.
                
Von Willebrand factor ristocetin (ris-to-SEE-tin) cofactor activity. This test shows how well your von Willebrand factor works.
                
Factor VIII clotting activity. This test checks the clotting activity of factor VIII. Some people who have VWD have low levels of factor VIII activity, while others have normal levels.
                
Von Willebrand factor multimers. This test is done if one or more of the first three tests are abnormal. It shows the structure of your von Willebrand factor. The test helps your doctor diagnose what type of VWD you have.
                
Platelet function test. This test measures how well your platelets are working.
                
You may have these tests more than once to confirm a diagnosis. Your doctor also may refer you to a hematologist to confirm the diagnosis and for followup care. A hematologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood disorders.","Diagnosis involves evaluating bleeding history and specific laboratory tests, including:

1.  **Von Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen:** Measures the amount of vWF.
2.  **vWF activity:** Measures the function of vWF (e.g., ristocetin cofactor activity or collagen binding activity).
3.  **Factor VIII activity:** Assesses Factor VIII levels, which vWF carries and protects.

The first symptom of this condition is usually an impairment of night vision (night blindness), which can occur in early childhood. A progressive narrowing of the field of vision (tunnel vision) follows, as well as a decrease in the ability to see details (visual acuity). These vision problems are due to an ongoing loss of cells (atrophy) in the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye (retina) and a nearby network of blood vessels (the choroid).

What are the genetic changes related to galactosialidosis ?,"Mutations in the CTSA gene cause all forms of galactosialidosis. The CTSA gene provides instructions for making a protein called cathepsin A, which is active in cellular compartments called lysosomes. These compartments contain enzymes that digest and recycle materials when they are no longer needed. Cathepsin A works together with two enzymes, neuraminidase 1 and beta-galactosidase, to form a protein complex. This complex breaks down sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) attached to certain proteins (glycoproteins) or fats (glycolipids). Cathepsin A is also found on the cell surface, where it forms a complex with neuraminidase 1 and a protein called elastin binding protein. Elastin binding protein plays a role in the formation of elastic fibers, a component of the connective tissues that form the body's supportive framework.  CTSA mutations interfere with the normal function of cathepsin A. Most mutations disrupt the protein structure of cathepsin A, impairing its ability to form complexes with neuraminidase 1, beta-galactosidase, and elastin binding protein. As a result, these other enzymes are not functional, or they break down prematurely.  Galactosialidosis belongs to a large family of lysosomal storage disorders, each caused by the deficiency of a specific lysosomal enzyme or protein. In galactosialidosis, impaired functioning of cathepsin A and other enzymes causes certain substances to accumulate in the lysosomes.","Mutations in the *CTSA* gene, which encodes the protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA) enzyme.

"How to prevent Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Stroke ?","Even if you are at high risk for heart disease and stroke, you can help keep your heart and blood vessels healthy. You can do so by taking the following steps:
                
- Make sure that your diet is ""heart-healthy."" Meet with a registered dietitian to plan a diet that meets these goals:      - Include at least 14 grams of fiber daily for every 1,000 calories consumed. Foods high in fiber may help lower blood cholesterol. Oat bran, oatmeal, whole-grain breads and cereals, dried beans and peas (such as kidney beans, pinto beans, and black-eyed peas), fruits, and vegetables are all good sources of fiber. Increase the amount of fiber in your diet gradually to avoid digestive problems.    - Cut down on saturated fat. It raises your blood cholesterol level. Saturated fat is found in meats, poultry skin, butter, dairy products with fat, shortening, lard, and tropical oils such as palm and coconut oil. Your dietitian can figure out how many grams of saturated fat should be your daily maximum amount.    - Keep the cholesterol in your diet to less than 300 milligrams a day. Cholesterol is found in meat, dairy products, and eggs.    - Keep the amount of trans fat in your diet to a minimum. It's a type of fat in foods that raises blood cholesterol. Limit your intake of crackers, cookies, snack foods, commercially prepared baked goods, cake mixes, microwave popcorn, fried foods, salad dressings, and other foods made with partially hydrogenated oil. In addition, some kinds of vegetable shortening and margarines have trans fat. Check for trans fat in the Nutrition Facts section on the food package.    - If you smoke, quit. Your doctor can help you find ways to quit smoking.  - Ask your doctor whether you should take aspirin. Studies have shown that taking a low dose of aspirin every day can help reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. However, aspirin is not safe for everyone. Your doctor can tell you whether taking aspirin is right for you and exactly how much to take.  - Get prompt treatment for transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). Early treatment for TIAs, sometimes called mini-strokes, may help prevent or delay a future stroke. Signs of a TIA are sudden weakness, loss of balance, numbness, confusion, blindness in one or both eyes, double vision, difficulty speaking, or a severe headache.","*   Maintain a healthy weight.

What is (are) anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency ?,"Anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency (EDA-ID) is a form of ectodermal dysplasia, which is a group of conditions characterized by abnormal development of ectodermal tissues including the skin, hair, teeth, and sweat glands. In addition, immune system function is reduced in people with EDA-ID. The signs and symptoms of EDA-ID are evident soon after birth.  Skin abnormalities in people with EDA-ID include areas that are dry, wrinkled, or darker in color than the surrounding skin. Affected individuals tend to have sparse scalp and body hair (hypotrichosis). EDA-ID is also characterized by missing teeth (hypodontia) or teeth that are small and pointed. Most people with EDA-ID have a reduced ability to sweat (hypohidrosis) because they have fewer sweat glands than normal or their sweat glands do not function properly. An inability to sweat (anhidrosis) can lead to a dangerously high body temperature (hyperthermia), particularly in hot weather.  The immune deficiency in EDA-ID varies among people with this condition. People with EDA-ID often produce abnormally low levels of proteins called antibodies or immunoglobulins. Antibodies help protect the body against infection by attaching to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction. A reduction in antibodies makes it difficult for people with this disorder to fight off infections. In EDA-ID, immune system cells called T cells and B cells have a decreased ability to recognize and respond to foreign invaders (such as bacteria, viruses, and yeast) that have sugar molecules attached to their surface (glycan antigens). Other key aspects of the immune system may also be impaired, leading to recurrent infections.  People with EDA-ID commonly get infections in the lungs (pneumonia), ears (otitis media), sinuses (sinusitis), lymph nodes (lymphadenitis), skin, bones, and GI tract. Approximately one quarter of individuals with EDA-ID have disorders involving abnormal inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis.  The life expectancy of affected individuals depends of the severity of the immune deficiency; most people with this condition do not live past childhood.  There are two forms of this condition that have similar signs and symptoms and are distinguished by the modes of inheritance: X-linked recessive or autosomal dominant.","A rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal development of ectodermal structures (e.g., sparse hair, absent/malformed teeth, and reduced/absent sweating), *combined with immune system dysfunction* leading to increased susceptibility to infections.",0.67601836,0,"Anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the absence of sweat glands (anhidrosis), abnormal development of ectodermal structures (such as hair, teeth, and nails), and immune system deficiencies.

What is (are) Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome ?,"Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome is a multisystem, genetic condition characterized by blood platelet dysfunction with prolonged bleeding, visual impairment, and abnormally light coloring of the skin, hair, and eyes (oculocutaneous albinism). Long-term sun exposure greatly increases the risk of skin damage and skin cancers. Some individuals have colitis, kidney failure, and pulmonary fibrosis. Symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis usually appear during the early thirties and rapidly worsen. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. There are nine different types of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, which can be distinguished by their signs and symptoms and underlying genetic cause. Types 1 and 4 are the most severe forms. Types 1, 2, and 4 are the only types associated with pulmonary fibrosis. Individuals with type 3, 5, or 6 have the mildest symptoms of all the types. Little is known about the signs, symptoms, and severity of types 7, 8 and 9.","Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a rare, inherited (autosomal recessive) disorder characterized by:

How to diagnose Thrombocytopenia ?,"Your doctor will diagnose thrombocytopenia based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. A hematologist also may be involved in your care. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood diseases and conditions.
                
Once thrombocytopenia is diagnosed, your doctor will begin looking for its cause.
                
Medical History
                
Your doctor may ask about factors that can affect your platelets, such as:
                
The medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines and herbal remedies, and whether you drink beverages that contain quinine. Quinine is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products.
                
Your general eating habits, including the amount of alcohol you normally drink.
                
Your risk for AIDS, including questions about blood transfusions, sexual partners, intravenous (IV) drugs, and exposure to infectious blood or bodily fluids at work.
                
Any family history of low platelet counts.
                
Physical Exam
                
Your doctor will do a physical exam to look for signs and symptoms of bleeding, such as bruises or spots on the skin. He or she will check your abdomen for signs of an enlarged spleen or liver. You also will be checked for signs of infection, such as a fever.
                
Diagnostic Tests
                
Your doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests to help diagnose a low platelet count. For more information about blood tests, go to the Health Topics Blood Tests article.
                
Complete Blood Count
                
A complete blood count (CBC) measures the levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. For this test, a small amount of blood is drawn from a blood vessel, usually in your arm.
                
If you have thrombocytopenia, the results of this test will show that your platelet count is low.
                
Blood Smear
                
A blood smear is used to check the appearance of your platelets under a microscope. For this test, a small amount of blood is drawn from a blood vessel, usually in your arm.
                
Bone Marrow Tests
                
Bone marrow tests check whether your bone marrow is healthy. Blood cells, including platelets, are made in your bone marrow. The two bone marrow tests are aspiration (as-pih-RA-shun) and biopsy.
                
Bone marrow aspiration might be done to find out why your bone marrow isn't making enough blood cells. For this test, your doctor removes a sample of fluid bone marrow through a needle. He or she examines the sample under a microscope to check for faulty cells.
                
A bone marrow biopsy often is done right after an aspiration. For this test, your doctor removes a sample of bone marrow tissue through a needle. He or she examines the tissue to check the number and types of cells in the bone marrow.
                
Other Tests
                
If a bleeding problem is suspected, you may need other blood tests as well. For example, your doctor may recommend PT and PTT tests to see whether your blood is clotting properly.
                
Your doctor also may suggest an ultrasound to check your spleen. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create pictures of your spleen. This will allow your doctor to see whether your spleen is enlarged.","Thrombocytopenia is diagnosed primarily by:

1.  **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Reveals a platelet count below the normal range.
2.  **Peripheral Blood Smear:** Confirms low platelets, checks for platelet clumping, and assesses red/white blood cell morphology.
3.  **Clinical History & Physical Exam:** To identify potential causes (e.g., medications, infections, bleeding, underlying conditions).
4.  **Further Specific Tests (if needed):** May include coagulation studies, antibody tests, or bone marrow examination to determine the underlying cause.",0.6864001,0,"Thrombocytopenia is diagnosed through:

What are the genetic changes related to amelogenesis imperfecta ?,"Mutations in the AMELX, ENAM, MMP20, and FAM83H genes can cause amelogenesis imperfecta. The AMELX, ENAM, and MMP20 genes provide instructions for making proteins that are essential for normal tooth development. Most of these proteins are involved in the formation of enamel, which is the hard, calcium-rich material that forms the protective outer layer of each tooth. Although the function of the protein produced from the FAM83H gene is unknown, it is also believed to be involved in the formation of enamel. Mutations in any of these genes result in altered protein structure or prevent the production of any protein. As a result, tooth enamel is abnormally thin or soft and may have a yellow or brown color. Teeth with defective enamel are weak and easily damaged.  Mutations in the genes described above account for only about half of all cases of the condition, with FAM83H gene mutations causing the majority of these cases. In the remaining cases, the genetic cause has not been identified. Researchers are working to find mutations in other genes that are involved in this disorder.","Amelogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins essential for enamel formation, most commonly *AMELX*, *ENAM*, *MMP20*, and *KLK4*. Inheritance patterns vary.",0.7934199,1,"Amelogenesis imperfecta is primarily associated with mutations in genes involved in enamel formation. Key genes include:

1. **AMELX** - Amelogenin gene, mutations can lead to X-linked forms.
2. **ENAM** - Enamelin gene, mutations affect enamel matrix.
3. **MMP20** - Matrix metalloproteinase 20, involved in enamel maturation.
4. **KLK4** - Kallikrein-related peptidase 4, also plays a role in enamel maturation.

These genetic changes disrupt the normal development and mineralization of enamel, leading to the characteristic dental defects.",0.8486833,1
What are the symptoms of Jones syndrome ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of Jones syndrome? Jones syndrome is primarily characterized by gingival fibromatosis (slowly progressive enlargement of the gums) and progressive, sensorineural hearing loss. Enlargement of the gingival tissue usually begins at the time the permanent teeth are erupting, although it may occur before. Excessive growth of the gums may cause displacement of teeth, over-retention of primary teeth, increased spacing, speech problems, and painful chewing. Absence of teeth (oligodontia) and extra (supernumerary) teeth have also been reported in people with Jones syndrome. Hearing loss has been reported to begin in the second or third decade of life and is bilateral (in both ears). Overlapping of symptoms with other syndromes associated with hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF) has been reported, including Zimmermann-Laband syndrome and gingival fibromatosis-hypertrichosis syndrome (HGF with excessive hair growth).

What are the treatments for What I need to know about Hirschsprung Disease ?,"Pull-through Procedure
                
HD is treated with surgery called a pull-through procedure. A surgeon removes the segment of the large intestine lacking nerve cells and connects the healthy segment to the anus. The pull-through procedure is usually done soon after diagnosis.
                
Ostomy surgery
                
An ostomy allows stool to leave the body through an opening in the abdomen. Although most children with HD do not need an ostomy, a child who has been very sick from HD may need an ostomy to get better before the pull-through procedure.
                
For ostomy surgery, the surgeon first takes out the diseased segment of the large intestine. The end of the healthy intestine is moved to an opening in the abdomen where a stoma is created. A stoma is created by rolling the intestines end back on itself, like a shirt cuff, and stitching it to the abdominal wall. An ostomy pouch is attached to the stoma and worn outside the body to collect stool. The pouch will need to be emptied several times each day.
                

                
If the surgeon removes the entire large intestine and connects the small intestine to the stoma, the surgery is called an ileostomy. If the surgeon leaves part of the large intestine and connects it to the stoma, the surgery is called a colostomy.
                
Later, during the pull-through procedure, the surgeon removes the stoma and closes the abdomen with stitches.","The primary treatment for Hirschsprung Disease is **surgical resection** of the aganglionic (non-functioning) bowel segment. This is typically a **pull-through procedure** that connects the healthy bowel to the anus.

What is (are) Cataract ?,"The lens is a clear part of the eye that helps to focus light, or an image, on the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. In a normal eye, light passes through the transparent lens to the retina. Once it reaches the retina, light is changed into nerve signals that are sent to the brain. The lens must be clear for the retina to receive a sharp image. If the lens is cloudy from a cataract, the image you see will be blurred.","Cataract is the clouding of the natural lens of the eye, which leads to blurry or decreased vision.",0.7098846,0,"A cataract is a clouding of the eye's natural lens, leading to decreased vision.

What to do for Primary Biliary Cirrhosis ?,"A healthy diet is important in all stages of cirrhosis because malnutrition is common in people with this disease. Malnutrition is a condition that occurs when the body does not get enough nutrients. Cirrhosis may lead to malnutrition because it can cause
                
- people to eat less because of symptoms such as loss of appetite  - changes in metabolism  - reduced absorption of vitamins and minerals
                
Health care providers can recommend a meal plan that is well balanced and provides enough calories and protein. If ascites develops, a health care provider or dietitian may recommend a sodium-restricted diet. To improve nutrition, the health care provider may prescribe a liquid supplement. A person may take the liquid by mouth or through a nasogastric tubea tiny tube inserted through the nose and throat that reaches into the stomach.
                
A person with cirrhosis should not eat raw shellfish, which can contain a bacterium that causes serious infection.

Is Non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency inherited ?,"Is non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency inherited? Non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (NCAH) is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier.","Yes, Non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.",0.7868479,1,"Yes, non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.",0.7896386,1

What are the treatments for National Hormone and Pituitary Program (NHPP): Information for People Treated with Pituitary Human Growth Hormone (Comprehensive Report) ?,"The HHS has identified 29 cases of CJD among the nearly 7,700 people in the United States who received NHPP pituitary hGH. None of the 29 people who got CJD began treatment with pituitary hGH after 1977, the year that the NHPP began producing pituitary hGH in a laboratory (headed by Dr. Albert Parlow) using a new purification step. Today, the growth hormone used to treat patients is made biosynthetically and not from human pituitary glands. Biosynthetic growth hormone (bGH), also known as recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH), poses no threat of infection with CJD.
                
Based on NHPP records, the HHS estimated 7,700 people were treated with pituitary hGH from the NHPP. Of these, the HHS got the names and addresses of 6,272 from their doctors and treatment centers so that their health could be monitored. Another 1,400 people are believed to have been treated with pituitary hGH; however, the HHS does not have their names and addresses. The HHS hoped to learn about CJD and other health problems in the unmonitored group of 1,400 and notified many doctors about the problem of CJD, asking them to report CJD among people treated with pituitary hGH. The HHS has learned that five of the 29 people with confirmed CJD were among the 1,400 people the HHS was not able to identify and study.
                
Some U.S. laboratories that made pituitary hGH for the NHPP also made hGH for use in other countries. The HHS learned that six people in New Zealand and two people in Brazil who received U.S.-made pituitary hGH may also have gotten CJD. A total of 37 people who were treated with pituitary hGH made in the United States may have gotten CJD.
                
Before bGH was available, several pharmaceutical companies made pituitary hGH. Some children treated in the U.S. received hormone produced by these companies when NHPP hGH was not available to them. Some of the 29 people with confirmed CJD received hGH from both the NHPP and a pharmaceutical company. Recently, the HHS has learned of an individual treated in the U.S. who developed CJD and received only commercial pituitary hGH. That person was not eligible for NHPP hGH and received pituitary hGH made by two pharmaceutical companies.","For individuals treated with cadaveric pituitary human growth hormone (hGH) under programs like NHPP, the primary concern is the potential risk of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).

Peripheral neuropathy is the most common type of diabetic neuropathy, and it affects the sensory nerves of your feet, legs, hands, and arms. These areas of your body may feel
                
- numb  - weak  - cold  - burning or tingling, like pins and needles
                
You may feel extreme pain in these areas of your body, even when they are touched lightly. You also may feel pain in your legs and feet when walking.
                
These feelings are often worse at night and can make it hard to sleep. Most of the time, you will have these feelings on both sides of your body, such as in both feet; however, they can occur just on one side.
                

                
You might have other problems, such as
                
- swollen feet  - loss of balance  - loss of muscle tone in your hands and feet  - a deformity or shape change in your toes and feet  - calluses or open sores on your feet
                
Autonomic Neuropathy
                
Autonomic neuropathy can affect your
                
- digestive system  - sex organs  - bladder  - sweat glands  - eyes  - heart rate and blood pressure  - ability to sense low blood glucose
                
Digestive system. Damage to nerves in your stomach, intestines, and other parts of your digestive system may
                
- make it hard to swallow both solid food and liquids  - cause stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea  - make it hard to keep your blood glucose under control
                
Your doctor or dietitian may advise you to eat smaller, more frequent meals; avoid fatty foods; and eat less fiber.
                
Sex organs. Damage to nerves in the sex organs may
                
- prevent a mans penis from getting firm when he wants to have sex, called erectile dysfunction or impotence. Many men who have had diabetes for several years have impotence.  - prevent a womans vagina from getting wet when she wants to have sex. A woman might also have less feeling around her vagina.
                
Bladder. Damage to nerves in your bladder may make it hard to know when you need to urinate and when your bladder is empty. This damage can cause you to hold urine for too long, which can lead to bladder infections. You also might leak drops of urine.
                

                
Sweat glands. Damage to nerves in your sweat glands may prevent them from working properly. Nerve damage can cause you to sweat a lot at night or while eating.
                
Eyes. Damage to nerves in your pupils, the parts of your eyes that react to changes in light and darkness, may make them slow to respond to these changes. You may have trouble seeing the lights of other cars when driving at night. Your eyes may take longer to adjust when you enter a dark room.
                

                
Heart rate and blood pressure. Damage to nerves that control your heart rate and blood pressure may make these nerves respond more slowly to changes in position, stress, physical activity, sleep, and breathing patterns. You might feel dizzy or pass out when you go from lying down to standing up or when you do physical activity. You also might have shortness of breath or swelling in your feet.
                

                
Ability to sense low blood glucose. Autonomic nerves also let you know when your blood glucose is low. Damage to these nerves can prevent you from feeling the symptoms of low blood glucose, also called hypoglycemia. This kind of nerve damage is more likely to happen if you have had diabetes for a long time or if your blood glucose has often been too low. Low blood glucose can make you
                
- hungry  - dizzy or shaky  - confused  - pale  - sweat more  - weak  - anxious or cranky  - have headaches  - have a fast heartbeat
                
Severe hypoglycemia can cause you to pass out. If that happens, youll need help bringing your blood glucose level back to normal. Your health care team can teach your family members and friends how to give you an injection of glucagon, a hormone that raises blood glucose levels quickly. If glucagon is not available, someone should call 911 to get you to the nearest emergency room for treatment.
                

                
Consider wearing a diabetes medical alert identification bracelet or necklace. If you have hypoglycemia and are not able to communicate, the emergency team will know you have diabetes and get you the proper treatment. You can find these bracelets or necklaces at your pharmacy or on the Internet. You can also ask your doctor for information on available products.

What are the symptoms of Osteoarthritis ?,"Pain and Stiffness in Joints Different types of arthritis have different symptoms. In general, people with most forms of arthritis have pain and stiffness in their joints. Osteoarthritis usually develops slowly and can occur in any joint, but often occurs in weight-bearing joints. Early in the disease, joints may ache after physical work or exercise. Most often, osteoarthritis occurs in the hands, hips, knees, neck, or low back. Common Signs Common signs of osteoarthritis include - joint pain, swelling, and tenderness  - stiffness after getting out of bed  - a crunching feeling or sound of bone rubbing on bone. joint pain, swelling, and tenderness stiffness after getting out of bed a crunching feeling or sound of bone rubbing on bone. Not everyone with osteoarthritis feels pain, however. In fact, only a third of people with x-ray evidence of osteoarthritis report pain or other symptoms. Diagnosis To make a diagnosis of osteoarthritis, most doctors use a combination of methods and tests including a medical history, a physical examination, x-rays, and laboratory tests. - A medical history is the patient's description of symptoms and when and how they began. The description covers pain, stiffness, and joint function, and how these have changed over time.   - A physical examination includes the doctor's examination of the joints, skin, reflexes, and muscle strength. The doctor observes the patient's ability to walk, bend, and carry out activities of daily living.  - X-rays are limited in their capacity to reveal how much joint damage may have occurred in osteoarthritis. X-rays usually don't show osteoarthritis damage until there has been a significant loss of cartilage.  A medical history is the patient's description of symptoms and when and how they began.

X-rays usually don't show osteoarthritis damage until there has been a significant loss of cartilage. Questions Your Doctor May Ask It is important for people with joint pain to give the doctor a complete medical history. Answering these questions will help your doctor make an accurate diagnosis: - Is the pain in one or more joints?  - When does the pain occur and how long does it last?  - When did you first notice the pain?  - Does activity make the pain better or worse?  - Have you had any illnesses or accidents that may account for the pain?  - Is there a family history of any arthritis or rheumatic diseases?  - What medicines are you taking? Is the pain in one or more joints? When does the pain occur and how long does it last? When did you first notice the pain? Does activity make the pain better or worse? Have you had any illnesses or accidents that may account for the pain? Is there a family history of any arthritis or rheumatic diseases? What medicines are you taking? A patient's attitudes, daily activities, and levels of anxiety or depression have a lot to do with how severe the symptoms of osteoarthritis may be. Who Can Provide Care Treating arthritis often requires a multidisciplinary or team approach. Many types of health professionals care for people with arthritis. You may choose a few or more of the following professionals to be part of your health care team. - Primary care physicians -- doctors who treat patients before they are referred to other specialists in the health care system. Often a primary care physician will be the main doctor to treat your arthritis. Primary care physicians also handle other medical problems and coordinate the care you receive from other physicians and health care providers.

How to diagnose Parkinson's Disease ?,"There are currently no blood or laboratory tests to diagnose sporadic Parkinson's disease. Diagnosis is based on a person's medical history and a neurological examination, but the disease can be difficult to diagnose accurately. Doctors may sometimes request brain scans or laboratory tests in order to rule out other diseases. However, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans of people with Parkinson's usually appear normal. Recently, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) has approved an imaging technique called DaTscan, which may help to increase accuracy of the diagnosis of Parkinsons disease. Since many other diseases have similar features but require different treatments, it is very important to make an exact diagnosis as soon as possible to ensure proper treatment.","Parkinson's Disease is primarily diagnosed clinically by a neurologist based on a neurological examination. Key diagnostic features include:

1.  **Cardinal Motor Symptoms:** The presence of at least two of the four cardinal motor symptoms: bradykinesia (slowness of movement), resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability (though this usually appears later).
2.  **Asymmetry:** Symptoms often begin on one side of the body.
3.  **Response to Levodopa:** A significant improvement in motor symptoms after taking Levodopa strongly supports the diagnosis.

What causes Osteoarthritis ?,"Risk Increases With Age Researchers suspect that osteoarthritis is caused by a combination of factors in the body and the environment. The chance of developing osteoarthritis increases with age. It is estimated that 33.6% (12.4 million) of individuals age 65 and older are affected by the disease. Wear and Tear on Joints Affects Cartilage Osteoarthritis often results from years of wear and tear on joints. This wear and tear mostly affects the cartilage, the tissue that cushions the ends of bones within the joint. Osteoarthritis occurs when the cartilage begins to fray, wear away, and decay. Putting too much stress on a joint that has been previously injured, improper alignment of joints, and excess weight all may contribute to the development of osteoarthritis.","Degeneration of joint cartilage due to wear and tear, age, genetics, obesity, and previous joint injury.",0.76540995,1,"Osteoarthritis is caused by the breakdown of cartilage in joints due to factors such as aging, joint injury, obesity, genetics, and repetitive stress on the joints.",0.7767944,1

How to diagnose Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) ?,"Diagnostic Challenges
  
For doctors, diagnosing chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) can be complicated by a number of factors:
  
   - There's no lab test or biomarker for CFS.
   - Fatigue and other symptoms of CFS are common to many illnesses.
   - For some CFS patients, it may not be obvious to doctors that they are ill.
   - The illness has a pattern of remission and relapse.
   - Symptoms vary from person to person in type, number, and severity.
  
  
These factors have contributed to a low diagnosis rate. Of the one to four million Americans who have CFS, less than 20% have been diagnosed.
  Exams and Screening Tests for CFS
  
Because there is no blood test, brain scan, or other lab test to diagnose CFS, the doctor should first rule out other possible causes.
  
If a patient has had 6 or more consecutive months of severe fatigue that is reported to be unrelieved by sufficient bed rest and that is accompanied by nonspecific symptoms, including flu-like symptoms, generalized pain, and memory problems, the doctor should consider the possibility that the patient may have CFS. Further exams and tests are needed before a diagnosis can be made:
  
   - A detailed medical history will be needed and should include a review of medications that could be causing the fatigue and symptoms
   - A thorough physical and mental status examination will also be needed
   - A battery of laboratory screening tests will be needed to help identify or rule out other possible causes of the symptoms that could be treated
   - The doctor may also order additional tests to follow up on results of the initial screening tests
  
  
A CFS diagnosis requires that the patient has been fatigued for 6 months or more and has 4 of the 8 symptoms for CFS for 6 months or more. If, however, the patient has been fatigued for 6 months or more but does not have four of the eight symptoms, the diagnosis may be idiopathic fatigue.

What causes Klinefelter syndrome ?,"What causes Klinefelter syndrome? Klinefelter syndrome usually occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm). An error in cell division called nondisjunction results in a reproductive cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes. For example, an egg or sperm cell may gain one or more extra copies of the X chromosome as a result of nondisjunction. If one of these atypical reproductive cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have one or more extra X chromosomes in each of the body's cells. Most often, Klinefelter syndrome is caused by a single extra copy of the X chromosome, resulting in a total of 47 chromosomes per cell. Males normally have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome in each cell (46, XY), while females have two X chromosomes (46, XX). People with Klinefelter syndrome usually have two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome (47, XXY). Some people with Klinefelter syndrome have the extra X chromosome in only some of their cells; these people are said to have mosaic Klinefelter syndrome. It is estimated that about half of the time, the cell division error occurs during development of the sperm, while the remainder are due to errors in egg development. Women who have pregnancies after age 35 have a slightly increased chance of having offspring with this syndrome. The features of Klinefelter syndrome are due to the extra copies of genes on the extra X chromosome, which can alter male sexual development.","An extra X chromosome in males (XXY), typically due to an error during cell division (nondisjunction) in the egg or sperm.",0.65808946,0,"Klinefelter syndrome is caused by the presence of an extra X chromosome in males, resulting in a 47,XXY karyotype.

The shortage of red blood cells in the blood circulation and the abundance of cells in the spleen are responsible for the signs and symptoms of this condition.  Mutations in the ANK1 gene are responsible for about half of all cases of hereditary spherocytosis. The other genes associated with hereditary spherocytosis account for a smaller percentage of cases and include the EPB42, SLC4A1, SPTA1, and SPTB genes.","Genetic defects (mutations) in genes that code for proteins of the red blood cell membrane, such as spectrin, ankyrin, band 3, and protein 4.2.",0.56292665,0,"Hereditary spherocytosis is caused by genetic mutations that affect proteins in the red blood cell membrane, leading to a loss of membrane stability.

Not all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:
                
Avocados
                
Corn, sunflower, and soybean oils
                
Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts
                
Olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils
                
Peanut butter
                
Salmon and trout
                
Tofu
                
Sodium
                
You should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.
                
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
                
Your doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.
                
The DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.
                
Alcohol
                
Try to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol will raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.
                
Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:
                
12 ounces of beer
                
5 ounces of wine
                
1 ounces of liquor
                
Maintaining a Healthy Weight
                
Maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for coronary heart disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.
                
Knowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:
                
Below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.
                
Between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.
                
Between 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight.
                
A BMI of 30.0 or higher is considered obese.
                
A general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.
                
Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk. For more information about losing weight or maintaining your weight, visit Aim for a Healthy Weight.
                
If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.
                
Managing Stress
                
Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:
                
A stress management program
                
Meditation
                
Physical activity
                
Relaxation therapy
                
Talking things out with friends or family
                
Physical Activity
                
Regular physical activity can lower many atherosclerosis risk factors, including LDL or bad cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL or good cholesterol, which helps prevent atherosclerosis.
                
Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2 hours and 30 minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.
                
Talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you. Read more about physical activity at:

Quitting Smoking
                
If you smoke or use tobacco, quit. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for atherosclerosis. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.
                
For more information about how to quit smoking, visit Smoking and Your Heart.
                
Medicines
                
Sometimes lifestyle changes alone arent enough to control your cholesterol levels. For example, you also may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have:
                
Coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, or had a prior stroke
                
Diabetes
                
High LDL cholesterol levels
                
Doctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with people who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke. Your doctor also may prescribe other medications to:
                
Lower your blood pressure
                
Lower your blood sugar levels
                
Prevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack and stroke
                
Prevent inflammation
                
Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. You should still follow a heart healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your atherosclerosis.
                
Medical Procedures and Surgery
                
If you have severe atherosclerosis, your doctor may recommend a medical procedure or surgery.
                
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as coronary angioplasty, is a procedure thats used to open blocked or narrowed coronary (heart) arteries. PCI can improve blood flow to the heart and relieve chest pain. Sometimes a small mesh tube called a stent is placed in the artery to keep it open after the procedure.
                
Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a type of surgery. In CABG, arteries or veins from other areas in your body are used to bypass or go around your narrowed coronary arteries. CABG can improve blood flow to your heart, relieve chest pain, and possibly prevent a heart attack.
                
Bypass grafting also can be used for leg arteries. For this surgery, a healthy blood vessel is used to bypass a narrowed or blocked artery in one of the legs. The healthy blood vessel redirects blood around the blocked artery, improving blood flow to the leg.
                
Carotid endarterectomy is a type of surgery to remove plaque buildup from the carotid arteries in the neck. This procedure restores blood flow to the brain, which can help prevent a stroke.","Treatments for atherosclerosis include:
*   **Lifestyle changes:** Diet, exercise, smoking cessation.
*   **Medications:** Statins, antiplatelets (e.g., aspirin), blood pressure medications, diabetes medications.
*   **Procedures:** Angioplasty, stenting, bypass surgery (CABG).",0.70282555,0,"Treatments for atherosclerosis include:

What are the symptoms of Hepatic venoocclusive disease with immunodeficiency ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of Hepatic venoocclusive disease with immunodeficiency? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hepatic venoocclusive disease with immunodeficiency. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the liver - Absence of lymph node germinal center - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Endocardial fibrosis - IgG deficiency - Immunodeficiency - Microcephaly - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available.

                    Breast cancer may occur in men. Men at any age may develop breast cancer, but it is usually detected (found) in men between 60 and 70 years of age. Male breast cancer makes up less than 1% of all cases of breast cancer.   The following types of breast cancer are found in men:         -  Infiltrating ductal carcinoma: Cancer that has spread beyond the cells lining ducts in the breast. Most men with breast cancer have this type of cancer.    -  Ductal carcinoma in situ: Abnormal cells that are found in the lining of a duct; also called intraductal carcinoma.    -  Inflammatory breast cancer: A type of cancer in which the breast looks red and swollen and feels warm.     -  Paget disease of the nipple: A tumor that has grown from ducts beneath the nipple onto the surface of the nipple.

How to diagnose Varicose Veins ?,"Doctors often diagnose varicose veins based on a physical exam alone. Sometimes tests or procedures are used to find out the extent of the problem or to rule out other conditions.
                
Specialists Involved
                
If you have varicose veins, you may see a vascular medicine specialist or vascular surgeon. These doctors specialize in blood vessel conditions. You also may see a dermatologist. This type of doctor specializes in skin conditions.
                
Physical Exam
                
To check for varicose veins in your legs, your doctor will look at your legs while you're standing or sitting with your legs dangling. He or she may ask you about your signs and symptoms, including any pain you're having.
                
Diagnostic Tests and Procedures
                
Duplex Ultrasound
                
Your doctor may recommend duplex ultrasound to check blood flow in your veins and to look for blood clots. Duplex ultrasound combines traditional with Doppler ultrasound. Traditional ultrasound uses sound waves to create apicture of the structures in your body, in this case the blood vessels and anything that may be blocking the flow of blood. Doppler ultrasound uses sound waves to create pictures of the flow or movement of the blood through theveins. The two types of ultrasound together paint a picture that helps your doctor diagnose your condition.
                
During this test, a handheld device will be placed on your body and passed back and forth over the affected area. The device sends and receives sound waves. A computer will convert the sound waves into a picture of the blood flow in your arteries and veins.
                
Angiogram
                
Although it is not very common, your doctor may recommend an angiogram to get a more detailed look at the blood flow through your veins.
                
For this procedure, dye is injected into your veins. The dye outlines your veins on x-ray images.
                
An angiogram can help your doctor confirm whether you have varicose veins or another condition.","Varicose veins are primarily diagnosed by:

1.  **Physical Examination:** Visual inspection and palpation of the characteristic dilated, tortuous veins.

What is (are) Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors ?,"Key Points 
                    - Central nervous system (CNS) embryonal tumors may begin in embryonic (fetal) cells that remain in the brain after birth.     - There are different types of CNS embryonal tumors.    - Pineoblastomas form in cells of the pineal gland.    - Certain genetic conditions increase the risk of childhood CNS embryonal tumors.    - Signs and symptoms of childhood CNS embryonal tumors or pineoblastomas depend on the child's age and where the tumor is.    - Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect (find) childhood CNS embryonal tumors or pineoblastomas.     - A biopsy may be done to be sure of the diagnosis of CNS embryonal tumor or pineoblastoma.    - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    Central nervous system (CNS) embryonal tumors may begin in embryonic (fetal) cells that remain in the brain after birth.
                    Central nervous system (CNS) embryonal tumors form in embryonic cells that remain in the brain after birth. CNS embryonal tumors tend to spread through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to other parts of the brain and spinal cord.   The tumors may be malignant (cancer) or benign (not cancer). Most CNS embryonal tumors in children are malignant. Malignant brain tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other parts of the brain. When a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain, it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should. Benign brain tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain. They rarely spread to other parts of the brain. Both benign and malignant brain tumors can cause signs or symptoms and need treatment.   Although cancer is rare in children, brain tumors are the third most common type of childhood cancer, after leukemia and lymphoma. This summary is about the treatment of primary brain tumors (tumors that begin in the brain). The treatment of metastatic brain tumors, which begin in other parts of the body and spread to the brain, is not discussed in this summary. For information about the different types of brain and spinal cord tumors, see the PDQ summary on Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment Overview.   Brain tumors occur in both children and adults. Treatment for adults may be different from treatment for children. See the PDQ summary on Adult Central Nervous System Tumors Treatment for more information on the treatment of adults.
                
                
                    There are different types of CNS embryonal tumors.
                    The different types of CNS embryonal tumors include:         -  Medulloblastomas  Most CNS embryonal tumors are medulloblastomas. Medulloblastomas are fast-growing tumors that form in brain cells in the cerebellum. The cerebellum is at the lower back part of the brain between the cerebrum and the brain stem. The cerebellum controls movement, balance, and posture. Medulloblastomas sometimes spread to the bone, bone marrow, lung, or other parts of the body, but this is rare.      -  Nonmedulloblastoma embryonal tumors  Nonmedulloblastoma embryonal tumors are fast-growing tumors that usually form in brain cells in the cerebrum. The cerebrum is at the top of the head and is the largest part of the brain. The cerebrum controls thinking, learning, problem-solving, emotions, speech, reading, writing, and voluntary movement. Nonmedulloblastoma embryonal tumors may also form in the brain stem or spinal cord.  There are four types of nonmedulloblastoma embryonal tumors:                  -  Embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes  Embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes (ETMR) are rare tumors that form in the brain and spinal cord. ETMR most commonly occur in young children and are fast-growing tumors.        -  Medulloepitheliomas  Medulloepitheliomas are fast-growing tumors that usually form in the brain, spinal cord or nerves just outside the spinal column. They occur most often in infants and young children.        -  CNS neuroblastomas  CNS neuroblastomas are a very rare type of neuroblastoma that form in the nerve tissue of the cerebrum or the layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord. CNS neuroblastomas may be large and spread to other parts of the brain or spinal cord.        -  CNS ganglioneuroblastomas  CNS ganglioneuroblastomas are rare tumors that form in nerve tissue of the brain and spinal cord. They may form in one area and be fast growing or form in more than one area and be slow growing.                      Childhood CNS atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor is also a type of embryonal tumor, but it is treated differently than other childhood CNS embryonal tumors. See the PDQ summary on Childhood Central Nervous System Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor Treatment for more information.
                
                
                    Pineoblastomas form in cells of the pineal gland.
                    The pineal gland is a tiny organ in the center of the brain. The gland makes melatonin, a substance that helps control our sleep cycle.    Pineoblastomas form in cells of the pineal gland and are usually malignant. Pineoblastomas are fast-growing tumors with cells that look very different from normal pineal gland cells. Pineoblastomas are not a type of CNS embryonal tumor but treatment for them is a lot like treatment for CNS embryonal tumors.   Pineoblastoma is linked with inherited changes in the retinoblastoma (RB1) gene. A child with the inherited form of retinoblastoma (cancer than forms in the tissues of the retina) has an increased risk of pineoblastoma. When retinoblastoma forms at the same time as a tumor in or near the pineal gland, it is called trilateral retinoblastoma. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) testing in children with retinoblastoma may detect pineoblastoma at an early stage when it can be treated successfully.",These are malignant brain or spinal cord tumors that arise from primitive (embryonic) cells that didn't fully differentiate during development. They are typically aggressive.,0.47645295,0,"Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors are a group of malignant tumors that arise from immature nerve cells in the brain or spinal cord.

These tumors typically occur in children and can affect brain function, leading to symptoms like headaches, nausea, and neurological deficits. Treatment often involves surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.",0.62679476,0
What is (are) laryngo-onycho-cutaneous syndrome ?,"Laryngo-onycho-cutaneous (LOC) syndrome is a disorder that leads to abnormalities of the voicebox (laryngo-), finger- and toenails (onycho-), and skin (cutaneous). Many of the condition's signs and symptoms are related to the abnormal growth of granulation tissue in different parts of the body. This red, bumpy tissue is normally produced during wound healing and is usually replaced by skin cells as healing continues. However, in people with LOC syndrome, this tissue grows even when there is no major injury.  One of the first symptoms in infants with LOC syndrome is a hoarse cry due to ulcers or overgrowth of granulation tissue in the voicebox (the larynx). Excess granulation tissue can also block the airways, leading to life-threatening breathing problems; as a result many affected individuals do not survive past childhood.  In LOC syndrome, granulation tissue also grows in the eyes, specifically the conjunctiva, which are the moist tissues that line the eyelids and the white part of the eyes. Affected individuals often have impairment or complete loss of vision due to the tissue overgrowth.  Another common feature of LOC syndrome is missing patches of skin (cutaneous erosions). The erosions heal slowly and may become infected. People with LOC syndrome can also have malformed nails and small, abnormal teeth.

What is (are) Hypomyelination with atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum ?,"Hypomyelination with atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum (H-ABC) is a disease that affects certain parts of the brain.  Symptoms usually begin in infancy or early childhood and vary in severity; they include movement difficulties and delay in mental development or learning problems.  These symptoms occur because certain brain cells in individuals with H-ABC are not fully covered by myelin (hypomyelination), a substance that usually surrounds nerve cells to help them work better.  Also, this condition causes the breakdown (atrophy) of two parts of the brain that help to coordinate movement - the basal ganglia and cerebellum.

What are the genetic changes related to KBG syndrome ?,"KBG syndrome is caused by mutations in the ANKRD11 gene. The protein produced from this gene enables other proteins to interact with each other and helps control gene activity. The ANKRD11 protein is found in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. It plays a role in the proper development of the brain and may be involved in the ability of neurons to change and adapt over time (plasticity), which is important for learning and memory. ANKRD11 may function in other cells in the body and appears to be involved in normal bone development.  Most of the ANKRD11 gene mutations involved in KBG syndrome lead to an abnormally short ANKRD11 protein, which likely has little or no function. Reduction of this protein's function is thought to underlie the signs and symptoms of the condition. Because ANKRD11 is thought to play an important role in neurons and brain development, researchers speculate that a partial loss of its function may lead to developmental delay and intellectual disability in KBG syndrome. However, the mechanism is not fully known. It is also unclear how loss of ANKRD11 function leads to the skeletal features of the condition.","Mutations in the *ANKRD11* gene, typically heterozygous loss-of-function (nonsense, frameshift, deletions) or missense mutations.",0.6309521,0,"KBG syndrome is primarily associated with mutations in the ANKRD11 gene, located on chromosome 16.

What causes Isovaleric acidemia ?,"What causes isovaleric acidemia? Isovaleric acidemia is caused by mutations in the IVD gene. The IVD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that plays an essential role in breaking down proteins from the diet. Specifically, this enzyme helps process the amino acid leucine, which is part of many proteins. If a mutation in the IVD gene reduces or eliminates the activity of this enzyme, the body is unable to break down leucine properly. As a result, an organic acid called isovaleric acid and related compounds build up to harmful levels in the body. This buildup damages the brain and nervous system, causing serious health problems.","Isovaleric acidemia is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme **isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase**, due to a mutation in the *IVD* gene.

What is (are) Cap myopathy ?,"Cap myopathy is a disorder that primarily affects skeletal muscles, the muscles that the body uses for movement. People with cap myopathy have muscle weakness (myopathy) and poor muscle tone (hypotonia) throughout the body, but they are most severely affected in the muscles of the face, neck, and limbs. The muscle weakness, which begins at birth or during childhood, can worsen over time. The name cap myopathy comes from characteristic abnormal cap-like structures that can be seen in muscle cells when muscle tissue is viewed under a microscope. The severity of cap myopathy is related to the percentage of muscle cells that have these caps. Individuals in whom 70 to 75 percent of muscle cells have caps typically have severe breathing problems and may not survive childhood, while those in whom 10 to 30 percent of muscle cells have caps have milder symptoms and can live into adulthood. Cap myopathy can be caused by mutations in the in the ACTA1, TPM2, or TPM3 genes. This condition follows an autosomal dominant manner of inheritance, however, most cases are not inherited; they result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.","Cap myopathy is a rare, congenital myopathy characterized by distinctive ""caps"" (abnormal protein aggregates) at the periphery of muscle fibers visible on biopsy, leading to muscle weakness and dysfunction.",0.81916547,1,"Cap myopathy is a rare muscle disorder characterized by the presence of cap-like structures in muscle fibers, often associated with weakness and muscle wasting.

What are the genetic changes related to homocystinuria ?,"Mutations in the CBS, MTHFR, MTR, MTRR, and MMADHC genes cause homocystinuria.  Mutations in the CBS gene cause the most common form of homocystinuria. The CBS gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called cystathionine beta-synthase. This enzyme acts in a chemical pathway and is responsible for converting the amino acid homocysteine to a molecule called cystathionine. As a result of this pathway, other amino acids, including methionine, are produced. Mutations in the CBS gene disrupt the function of cystathionine beta-synthase, preventing homocysteine from being used properly. As a result, this amino acid and toxic byproducts substances build up in the blood. Some of the excess homocysteine is excreted in urine.  Rarely, homocystinuria can be caused by mutations in several other genes. The enzymes made by the MTHFR, MTR, MTRR, and MMADHC genes play roles in converting homocysteine to methionine. Mutations in any of these genes prevent the enzymes from functioning properly, which leads to a buildup of homocysteine in the body. Researchers have not determined how excess homocysteine and related compounds lead to the signs and symptoms of homocystinuria.","Homocystinuria is primarily caused by mutations in the **CBS** gene. Less commonly, mutations in genes involved in methionine remethylation like **MTHFR**, **MTR**, **MTRR**, or those affecting cobalamin metabolism (e.g., **MMACHC** for cblC) can also be responsible.",0.7469062,0,"Homocystinuria is primarily caused by mutations in the CBS gene, which encodes the enzyme cystathionine beta-synthase.

Is Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency inherited ?,"How is pyruvate carboxylase deficiency inherited? Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that both copies of the disease-causing gene in each cell (usually one inherited from each parent) must have a mutation for an individual to be affected. Individuals who carry one mutated copy of the gene are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not have any signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers for an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be an unaffected carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% risk to not have the condition and not be a carrier (i.e. to inherit both normal genes). In other words, each child born to two carriers has a 75% (3 in 4) chance to be unaffected. De novo mutations (new mutations that occur for the first time in an individual and are not inherited from a parent) have been reported for this condition. This means that in some cases, an affected individual may have only one parent who is a carrier for the condition. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk may be possible through laboratories offering custom mutation analysis if the disease-causing mutations in a family are known. Individuals interested in learning more about genetic risks to themselves or family members, or about genetic testing for this condition, should speak with a genetics professional.","Yes, Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency is inherited.

What causes COPD ?,"Smoking Most cases of COPD develop over time, from breathing in fumes and other things that irritate the lungs. Some of the things that put you at risk for COPD include smoking, environmental exposure, and genetic factors. Cigarette smoking is the most common cause of COPD in the United States (either current or former smokers). Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoking can also cause COPD, especially if the smoke is inhaled. Environmental Exposure COPD can also occur in people who have had long-term exposure to things that can irritate your lungs, like chemical fumes, or dust from the environment or workplace. Heavy or long-term exposure to secondhand smoke or other air pollutants may also contribute to COPD even if you have never smoked or had long-term exposure to harmful pollutants. Secondhand smoke is smoke in the air from other people smoking. Genetic Factors In a small number of people, COPD is caused by a genetic condition known as alpha-1 antitrypsin, or AAT, deficiency. People who have this condition have low levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT)a protein made in the liver. Having a low level of the AAT protein can lead to lung damage and COPD if you're exposed to smoke or other lung irritants. If you have this condition and smoke, COPD can worsen very quickly. While very few people know if they have AAT deficiency, it is estimated that about 1 in every 1,600 people to about 1 in every 5,000 people have it. People with AAT deficiency can get COPD even if they have never smoked or had long-term exposure to harmful pollutants. Asthma Although uncommon, some people who have asthma can develop COPD. Asthma is a chronic (long-term) lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. Treatment usually can reverse the inflammation and narrowing. However, if not, COPD can develop.","Long-term exposure to irritating gases or particulate matter, most often from **cigarette smoke**.

How to diagnose Primary Familial Brain Calcification ?,"How is primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) diagnosed? The diagnosis of PFBC relies upon:   1) visualization of bilateral (on both sides) calcification of the basal ganglia on neuroimaging,  2) presence of progressive neurological dysfunction,  3) absence of a metabolic, infectious, toxic, or traumatic cause, and 4) a family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance (a person must inherit one copy of the altered gene from one parent to have the condition). Molecular genetic testing can help confirm the diagnosis. Is there genetic testing for primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) even though not all of the causitive genes are known? Genetic testing may help to confirm the diagnosis. For individuals in who a diagnosis of PFBC is being considered, other causes of brain calcification should be eliminated prior to pursuing genetic testing, particularly in simplex cases. Testing that might be done includes biochemical analysis of blood and urine, as well s analysis of cerebrospinal fluid. If no other primary cause for brain calcification is detected or if the family history is suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance, molecular genetic testing should be considered.  Sequencing of SLC20A2 should be pursued first. If no mutation is identified, deletion/duplication analysis of SLC20A2 may be considered. If no identifiable mutation or deletion in SLC20A2 is found, sequence analysis of PDGFRB and PDGFB may be considered.","Diagnosis primarily involves:

1.  **Brain CT scan:** Reveals characteristic bilateral, symmetrical intracranial calcifications (e.g., basal ganglia).

What are the treatments for Hypotension ?,"Treatment depends on the type of hypotension you have and the severity of your signs and symptoms. The goal of treatment is to bring blood pressure back to normal to relieve signs and symptoms. Another goal is to manage any underlying condition causing the hypotension.
                
Your response to treatment depends on your age, overall health, and strength. It also depends on how easily you can stop, start, or change medicines.
                
In a healthy person, low blood pressure without signs or symptoms usually isn't a problem and needs no treatment.
                
If you have signs or symptoms of hypotension, you should sit or lie down right away. Put your feet above the level of your heart. If your signs or symptoms don't go away quickly, you should seek medical care.
                
Orthostatic Hypotension
                
Many treatments are available for orthostatic hypotension. If you have this condition, your doctor may advise making lifestyle changes, such as:
                
Drinking plenty of fluids, such as water or sports drinks that contain nutrients like sodium and potassium.
                
Drinking little or no alcohol.
                
Standing up slowly.
                
Not crossing your legs while sitting.
                
Slowly increasing the amount of time you sit up if you've been immobile for a long time because of a medical condition. The term ""immobile"" refers to not being able to move around very much.
                
Eating small, low-carbohydrate meals if you have postprandial hypotension (a form of orthostatic hypotension).
                
Talk with your doctor about using compression stockings. These stockings apply pressure to your lower legs. The pressure helps move blood throughout your body.
                
If medicine is causing your low blood pressure, your doctor may change the medicine or adjust the dose you take.

Neurally Mediated Hypotension
                
If you have neurally mediated hypotension (NMH), you may need to make lifestyle changes. These may include:
                
Avoiding situations that trigger symptoms, such as standing for long periods. Unpleasant, upsetting, or scary situations also can trigger symptoms.
                
Drinking plenty of fluids, such as water or sports drinks that contain nutrients like sodium and potassium.
                
Increasing your salt intake (as your doctor advises).
                
Learning to recognize symptoms that occur before fainting and taking action to raise your blood pressure. For example, sitting down and putting your head between your knees or lying down can help raise blood pressure.
                
If medicine is causing your hypotension, your doctor may change the medicine or adjust the dose you take. He or she also may prescribe medicine to treat NMH.

What causes Hemochromatosis ?,"What causes hemochromatosis? The underlying cause of hemochromatosis depends on whether a person has a hereditary form, an acquired form, or the neonatal form. Hereditary hemochromatosis is caused by mutations in any of several genes: type 1 hemochromatosis - the HFE gene type 2 hemochromatosis - either the HFE2 or HAMP gene type 3 hemochromatosis - the TFR2 gene type 4 hemochromatosis - the SLC40A1 gene These genes give the body instructions to make proteins that help regulate how iron is absorbed, transported, and stored. Mutations in these genes impair how iron is absorbed during digestion and alter the distribution of iron throughout the body. This causes iron to accumulate in tissues and organs. Acquired hemochromatosis (or secondary hemochromatosis) is usually due to other blood-related disorders, such as thalassemia or certain anemias, or having many blood transfusions. Sometimes it occurs as a result of long-term alcoholism or other health conditions. The cause of neonatal hemochromatosis is not fully understood. However, a woman with an affected child has approximately an 80% chance to have another affected child. This likelihood of recurrence is not explained by normal inheritance patterns. Therefore, this form appears to be familial, but not inherited.",Hemochromatosis is caused by excessive iron absorption and accumulation in the body. It is often genetic (hereditary hemochromatosis) or can be acquired due to other medical conditions like frequent blood transfusions.,0.84020925,1,"Hemochromatosis is primarily caused by genetic mutations, most commonly in the HFE gene, leading to excessive iron absorption from the diet. Other causes can include chronic liver disease, repeated blood transfusions, and certain metabolic disorders.",0.85445976,1
What are the genetic changes related to familial exudative vitreoretinopathy ?,"Mutations in the FZD4, LRP5, and NDP genes can cause familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that participate in a chemical signaling pathway that affects the way cells and tissues develop. In particular, the proteins produced from the FZD4, LRP5, and NDP genes appear to play critical roles in the specialization of retinal cells and the establishment of a blood supply to the retina and the inner ear. The LRP5 protein also helps regulate bone formation.  Mutations in the FZD4, LRP5, or NDP gene disrupt chemical signaling during early development, which interferes with the formation of blood vessels at the edges of the retina. The resulting abnormal blood supply to this tissue leads to retinal damage and vision loss in some people with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy.  The eye abnormalities associated with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy tend to be similar no matter which gene is altered. However, affected individuals with LRP5 gene mutations often have reduced bone mineral density in addition to vision loss. Mutations in the other genes responsible for familial exudative vitreoretinopathy do not appear to affect bone density.  In some cases, the cause of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy is unknown. Researchers believe that mutations in several as-yet-unidentified genes are responsible for the disorder in these cases.","Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) is primarily associated with mutations in genes involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, including:

What are the treatments for Nephrocalcinosis ?,"How might nephrocalcinosis be treated? Treatment of nephrocalcinosis includes treating the underlying condition causing nephrocalcinosis, if it is known. The goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms and prevent more calcium from being deposited in the kidneys. Measures are usually taken to reduce abnormal levels of calcium, phosphate, and oxalate in the blood. Medications that cause calcium loss are typically stopped. Treatment of hypercalcemia (increased calcium levels in the blood) and hypercalcemic nephropathy typically includes adequate hydration by isotonic sodium chloride (normal saline) solution to reverse hypercalcemia and protect the kidneys. Treatment of macroscopic nephrocalcinosis (calcium deposition that is visible without magnification) may include thiazide diuretics and dietary salt restriction; potassium and magnesium supplementation; and citrate supplementation in idiopathic hypercalciuria (of unknown cause) and in distal renal tubular acidosis. Lessening of nephrocalcinosis may occur over time, but in many cases, such as when it results from primary hyperoxaluria or distal renal tubular acidosis, nephrocalcinosis is largely irreversible. Therefore, early detection and treatment are important. Individuals interested in learning about treatment options for themselves should speak with their health care provider or a nephrologist.","Treatment focuses on:

1.  **Addressing the underlying cause** (e.g., hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria).
2.  **Increased fluid intake** to dilute urine.
3.  **Dietary modifications** (e.g., low sodium, appropriate calcium/oxalate intake).

What are the genetic changes related to cap myopathy ?,"Mutations in the ACTA1, TPM2, or TPM3 genes can cause cap myopathy. These genes provide instructions for producing proteins that play important roles in skeletal muscles.  The ACTA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called skeletal alpha ()-actin, which is part of the actin protein family. Actin proteins are important for cell movement and the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction). Thin filaments made up of actin molecules and thick filaments made up of another protein called myosin are the primary components of muscle fibers and are important for muscle contraction. Attachment (binding) and release of the overlapping thick and thin filaments allows them to move relative to each other so that the muscles can contract. The mutation in the ACTA1 gene that causes cap myopathy results in an abnormal protein that may interfere with the proper assembly of thin filaments. The cap structures in muscle cells characteristic of this disorder are composed of disorganized thin filaments.  The TPM2 and TPM3 genes provide instructions for making proteins that are members of the tropomyosin protein family. Tropomyosin proteins regulate muscle contraction by attaching to actin and controlling its binding to myosin. The specific effects of TPM2 and TPM3 gene mutations are unclear, but researchers suggest they may interfere with normal actin-myosin binding between the thin and thick filaments, impairing muscle contraction and resulting in the muscle weakness that occurs in cap myopathy.","Mutations in the *NEB* gene, which encodes the nebulin protein, are the primary genetic cause.

In males (who have only one X chromosome), one changed (mutated) copy of the gene in each cell is enough to cause the condition because they don't have another X chromosome with a normal copy of the gene. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two mutated copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. Fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.","Yes, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is inherited.

Is permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus inherited ?,"Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus can have different inheritance patterns.  When this condition is caused by mutations in the KCNJ11 or INS gene it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In about 90 percent of these cases, the condition results from new mutations in the gene and occurs in people with no history of the disorder in their family. In the remaining cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent.  When permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus is caused by mutations in the ABCC8 gene, it may be inherited in either an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pattern. In autosomal recessive inheritance, both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

What is (are) Hajdu-Cheney syndrome ?,"Hajdu-Cheney syndrome is a rare disorder that can affect many parts of the body, particularly the bones. Loss of bone tissue from the hands and feet (acro-osteolysis) is a characteristic feature of the condition. The fingers and toes are short and broad, and they may become shorter over time as bone at the tips continues to break down. Bone loss in the fingers can interfere with fine motor skills, such as picking up small objects.  Bone abnormalities throughout the body are common in Hajdu-Cheney syndrome. Affected individuals develop osteoporosis, which causes the bones to be brittle and prone to fracture. Many affected individuals experience breakage (compression fractures) of the spinal bones (vertebrae). Some also develop abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis or kyphosis). Hajdu-Cheney syndrome also affects the shape and strength of the long bones in the arms and legs. The abnormalities associated with this condition lead to short stature.  Hajdu-Cheney syndrome also causes abnormalities of the skull bones, including the bones of the face. The shape of the skull is often described as dolichocephalic, which means it is elongated from back to front. In many affected individuals, the bone at the back of the skull bulges outward, causing a bump called a prominent occiput. Distinctive facial features associated with this condition include widely spaced and downward-slanting eyes, eyebrows that grow together in the middle (synophrys), low-set ears, a sunken appearance of the middle of the face (midface hypoplasia), and a large space between the nose and upper lip (a long philtrum). Some affected children are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth called a cleft palate or with a high arched palate. In affected adults, the facial features are often described as ""coarse.""  Other features of Hajdu-Cheney syndrome found in some affected individuals include joint abnormalities, particularly an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility); dental problems; hearing loss; a deep, gravelly voice; excess body hair; recurrent infections in childhood; heart defects; and kidney abnormalities such as the growth of multiple fluid-filled cysts (polycystic kidneys). Some people with this condition have delayed development in childhood, but the delays are usually mild.  The most serious complications of Hajdu-Cheney syndrome, which occur in about half of all affected individuals, are abnormalities known as platybasia and basilar invagination. Platybasia is a flattening of the base of the skull caused by thinning and softening of the skull bones. Basilar invagination occurs when the softened bones allow part of the spine to protrude abnormally through the opening at the bottom of the skull, pushing into the lower parts of the brain. These abnormalities can lead to severe neurological problems, including headaches, abnormal vision and balance, a buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus), abnormal breathing, and sudden death.  The signs and symptoms of Hajdu-Cheney syndrome vary greatly among affected individuals, even among members of the same family. Many of the disorder's features, such as acro-osteolysis and some of the characteristic facial features, are not present at birth but become apparent in childhood or later. The risk of developing platybasia and basilar invagination also increases over time.  The features of Hajdu-Cheney syndrome overlap significantly with those of a condition called serpentine fibula-polycystic kidney syndrome (SFPKS). Although they used to be considered separate disorders, researchers discovered that the two conditions are associated with mutations in the same gene. Based on these similarities, many researchers now consider Hajdu-Cheney syndrome and SFPKS to be variants of the same condition.","Hajdu-Cheney syndrome is a rare, autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by progressive acro-osteolysis (resorption of bone, particularly at the ends of fingers and toes), short stature, craniofacial abnormalities (e.g., hypertelorism, prominent forehead), and dental anomalies.

What are the genetic changes related to aminoacylase 1 deficiency ?,"Aminoacylase 1 deficiency is caused by mutations in the ACY1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aminoacylase 1, which is involved in the breakdown of proteins when they are no longer needed. Many proteins in the body have an acetyl group attached to one end. This modification, called N-acetylation, helps protect and stabilize the protein. Aminoacylase 1 performs the final step in the breakdown of these proteins by removing the acetyl group from certain amino acids. The amino acids can then be recycled and used to build other proteins.  Mutations in the ACY1 gene lead to an aminoacylase 1 enzyme with little or no function. Without this enzyme's function, acetyl groups are not efficiently removed from a subset of amino acids during the breakdown of proteins. The excess N-acetylated amino acids are released from the body in urine. It is not known how a reduction of aminoacylase 1 function leads to neurological problems in people with aminoacylase 1 deficiency.","Mutations in the *ACY1* gene, inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.",0.5935737,0,"Aminoacylase 1 deficiency is primarily caused by mutations in the ACY1 gene, which encodes the enzyme aminoacylase 1.

A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -  Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.
                    Thymoma and thymic carcinoma are usually diagnosed, staged, and treated during surgery. A biopsy of the tumor is done to diagnose the disease. The biopsy may be done before or during surgery (a mediastinoscopy or mediastinotomy), using a thin needle to remove a sample of cells. This is called a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Sometimes a wide needle is used to remove a sample of cells and this is called a core biopsy. A pathologist will view the sample under a microscope to check for cancer. If thymoma or thymic carcinoma is diagnosed, the pathologist will determine the type of cancer cell in the tumor. There may be more than one type of cancer cell in a thymoma. The surgeon will decide if all or part of the tumor can be removed by surgery. In some cases, lymph nodes and other tissues may be removed as well.","Diagnosis typically involves:

1.  **Imaging:** Chest X-ray, CT scan of the chest (primary), MRI.
2.  **Biopsy:** Core needle biopsy, mediastinoscopy, or surgical excisional biopsy provides definitive histological diagnosis.
3.  **Blood tests:** May include acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies if Myasthenia Gravis is suspected.",0.62907463,0,"Thymoma and thymic carcinoma are diagnosed through a combination of imaging studies and histopathological examination. Key steps include:

1. **Imaging Studies**: 
   - Chest X-ray
   - CT scan of the chest to assess the size and extent of the tumor.

2. **Biopsy**: 
   - Needle biopsy or surgical resection to obtain tissue samples for histological analysis.

3. **Histopathological Examination**: 
   - Microscopic evaluation of the tissue to differentiate between thymoma and thymic carcinoma based on cellular characteristics.

4. **Immunohistochemistry**: 
   - Additional tests may be performed to identify specific markers that help in classification.

5. **Clinical Evaluation**: 
   - Assessment of symptoms and any associated conditions, such as myasthenia gravis.

Consultation with a specialist, such as a thoracic surgeon or oncologist, is often necessary for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.",0.69192433,0
What is (are) High Blood Pressure and Kidney Disease ?,"Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against blood vessel walls as the heart pumps out blood, and high blood pressure, also called hypertension, is an increase in the amount of force that blood places on blood vessels as it moves through the body. Factors that can increase this force include higher blood volume due to extra fluid in the blood and blood vessels that are narrow, stiff, or clogged.
                
Blood pressure test results are written with two numbers separated by a slash. For example, a health care provider will write a blood pressure result as 120/80. A health care provider will say this blood pressure result as 120 over 80. The top number is called the systolic pressure and represents the pressure as the heart beats and pushes blood through the blood vessels. The bottom number is called the diastolic pressure and represents the pressure as blood vessels relax between heartbeats.
                
Most people without chronic health conditions have a normal blood pressure if it stays below 120/80. Prehypertension is a systolic pressure of 120 to 139 or a diastolic pressure of 80 to 89. High blood pressure is a systolic pressure of 140 or above or a diastolic pressure of 90 or above.1
                
People should talk with their health care provider about their individual blood pressure goals and how often they should have their blood pressure checked.","*   **High Blood Pressure (Hypertension):** A condition where the force of blood against your artery walls is consistently too high.
*   **Kidney Disease (Renal Disease):** Refers to conditions where the kidneys are damaged and cannot filter blood properly, leading to waste buildup.

They often co-exist and can worsen each other.",0.47045028,0,"High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a condition where the force of the blood against the artery walls is consistently too high, which can lead to heart disease and other health issues. 

Kidney disease refers to a range of conditions that affect kidney function, leading to the kidneys' inability to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood effectively. High blood pressure can cause or worsen kidney disease, and vice versa, creating a harmful cycle.",0.5545434,0
What causes Pachygyria ?,"What causes pachygyria? Pachygyria, also called ""incomplete lissencephaly,"" may be caused by various non-genetic (environmental) and genetic factors that play a role in impairing the development of the outer region of the brain (the cerebral cortex). The cerebral cortex is responsible for conscious movement and thought, and should have deep convolutions (gyri) and grooves (sulci), which are formed by ""infolding"" of the cerebral cortex. During normal embryonic growth, immature cells that later develop into specialized nerve cells (neurons) normally migrate to the brain's surface, making several layers of cells. When this process is impaired, the cells don't migrate to their locations, resulting in too few cell layers and absence (agyria) or incomplete development (pachygyria) of gyri. Environmental factors that contribute to the condition may include intrauterine infection during pregnancy (such as a virus), and insufficient flow of oxygenated blood to the brain (ischemia) during fetal development. More than 25 syndromes due to abnormal migration of neurons have been reported; in some of these cases, the genetic cause and pattern of inheritance depends on that of the specific syndrome. Mutations in several genes have been identified in people with abnormalities of cortical development, including the KIF5C, KIF2A, DYNC1H1, WDR62, and TUBG1 genes. Studies have also found that isolated lissencephaly may result from mutations in the LIS1 and XLIS (also called DCX) genes. People interested in learning about the cause of pachygyria in themselves or family members should speak with their health care provider or a a genetics professional.","Pachygyria is primarily caused by **genetic mutations** that disrupt neuronal migration during fetal brain development, leading to abnormally thick and few brain folds.",0.83064926,1,"Pachygyria is caused by abnormal brain development during fetal growth, often due to genetic mutations, disruptions in neuronal migration, or environmental factors such as infections or exposure to toxins during pregnancy. It is associated with various genetic syndromes and can lead to neurological deficits.",0.83609354,1
What is (are) Split hand foot malformation ?,"Split hand foot malformation (SHFM) is a type of birth defect that consists of missing digits (fingers and/or toes), a deep cleft down the center of the hand or foot, and fusion of remaining digits. The severity of this condition varies widely among affected individuals. SHFM is sometimes called ectrodactyly; however, this is a nonspecific term used to describe missing digits. SHFM may occur by itself (isolated) or it may be part of a syndrome with abnormalities in other parts of the body. At least six different forms of isolated SHFM have been described. Each type is associated with a different underlying genetic cause. SHFM1 has been linked to chromosome 7, and SHFM2 is linked to the X chromosome. SHFM3 is caused by a duplication of chromosome 10 at position 10q24. Changes (mutations) in the TP63 gene cause SHFM4. SHFM5 is linked to chromosome 2, and SHFM6 is caused by mutations in the WNT10B gene. SHFM may be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked manner.","Split hand foot malformation (SHFM) is a congenital limb difference characterized by the absence of the central rays of the hands and/or feet, resulting in a deep cleft that divides the limb into two parts, often giving a ""claw-like"" appearance.
