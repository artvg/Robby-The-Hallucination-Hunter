medquestions-500-0000,gpt-4o-mini_rude,What are the genetic changes related to familial adenomatous polyposis ?,"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is primarily caused by mutations in the **APC (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli)** gene. Here are the key genetic changes associated with FAP:

1. **APC Gene Mutations**: Most cases of FAP are due to inherited mutations in the APC gene, which is a tumor suppressor gene. These mutations lead to the development of numerous colorectal polyps and an increased risk of colorectal cancer.

2. **Inheritance Pattern**: FAP is inherited in an **autosomal dominant** manner, meaning that only one copy of the mutated gene from an affected parent can lead to the condition in offspring.

3. **Other Genetic Changes**: In some cases, additional mutations may occur in other genes (like KRAS, TP53) as the polyps progress to cancer, but the initial cause is the APC mutation.

4. **Variants of FAP**: There are also variants of FAP, such as **attenuated FAP (AFAP)**, which can be caused by specific mutations in the APC gene that lead to fewer polyps and a later onset of cancer.

In summary, the primary genetic change in familial adenomatous polyposis is a mutation in the APC gene, leading to the development of multiple colorectal polyps and an increased cancer risk.",4820,ok,
